          This Privacy Policy describes how ShipX, a joint platform operated by
          Amilo and SG Link under the ownership of INFI COMMERCE ECOSYSTEMS PTE.
          LTD., collects, uses, shares, and protects the personal information of
          individuals and businesses that engage with our services. ShipX
          respects your privacy and is committed to safeguarding the information
          you provide to us. By accessing or using our platform, you acknowledge
          that you have read and understood this Policy and agree to the
          practices it describes.
          <br />
          <br />
          We collect personal information in several ways, both directly and
          indirectly. When you register for an account, request services,
          complete forms, or communicate with our support team, you may provide
          details such as your full name, email address, phone number, billing
          and shipping information, payment details, and company identifiers. We
          also gather technical information automatically when you access our
          website, including your IP address, browser type, operating system,
          device identifiers, location data where legally permitted, and records
          of the pages you visit or the features you use. To improve our
          services, we may employ cookies, analytics tools, and similar tracking
          technologies that store preferences, recognize repeat visits, and
          analyze usage trends. In certain situations, we may also obtain
          information from third-party partners such as logistics providers,
          payment processors, and verification services to facilitate your
          transactions and maintain security.
          <br />
          <br />
          The information we collect is used for a wide range of purposes that
          are essential to the operation of ShipX. Primarily, we use it to
          provide the services you request, including account management,
          shipment processing, order fulfillment, billing, and customer support.
          We also process information to improve and optimize our platform,
          conduct internal analytics, protect the integrity of our systems,
          prevent fraudulent activity, and ensure compliance with applicable
          laws and regulations. When permitted by law and with your consent
          where required, we may use your contact details to send you updates,
          promotional offers, and marketing communications related to ShipX and
          its partners. At the same time, we respect your right to opt out of
          such communications at any time.
          <br />
          <br />
          ShipX operates under different legal bases depending on the nature of
          the data processing. In some cases, your consent provides the
          foundation for our activities, particularly when it comes to marketing
          communications or optional services. In other situations, we rely on
          the necessity of processing in order to fulfill our contractual
          obligations to you, such as delivering shipments or processing
          payments. We may also process data where required by law, for example,
          to maintain tax records or respond to lawful requests from
          authorities. Finally, we may process data based on our legitimate
          interests in operating and securing our platform, provided those
          interests do not override your rights and freedoms.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cookies and similar technologies play an important role in the
          functionality of our services. They enable us to remember your
          settings, authenticate your account, improve security, and deliver a
          more personalized experience. We also use cookies to measure traffic,
          analyze site performance, and support marketing campaigns. You have
          the ability to control or disable cookies through your browser
          settings; however, please note that certain features of ShipX may not
          work properly if cookies are disabled.
          <br />
          <br />
          We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.
          Nonetheless, there are circumstances where sharing data is necessary.
          We may disclose your information to our affiliates, including Amilo
          and SG Link, as part of our joint operations. Trusted service
          providers, such as data hosting companies, IT support providers,
          analytics vendors, payment processors, and logistics partners, may
          also have access to your data when assisting us in delivering
          services. We may disclose information if required to comply with laws,
          regulations, or legal processes, or in order to protect the safety,
          rights, or property of ShipX, our users, or the public. Furthermore,
          in the event of a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition,
          or sale of assets, your data may be transferred to the successor
          entity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Security of your information is a top priority for us. ShipX employs a
          combination of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
          designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access,
          alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption,
          firewalls, secure data storage, and restricted access protocols. While
          we strive to maintain the highest level of security, no online
          transmission or electronic storage method can be guaranteed to be 100
          percent secure, and you acknowledge that you provide information at
          your own risk.
          <br />
          <br />
          We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. This includes the
          duration of your account, the period required to comply with legal
          obligations, and any time necessary to resolve disputes or enforce
          agreements. Once data is no longer required, we take reasonable steps
          to delete, anonymize, or otherwise securely dispose of it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your rights regarding your personal information vary depending on the
          jurisdiction in which you reside. In certain regions, such as the
          European Union under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or
          in jurisdictions with similar laws, you may have the right to access
          the information we hold about you, request corrections, demand
          deletion of your data subject to lawful exceptions, restrict or object
          to processing, and request data portability. In jurisdictions with
          consumer privacy protections, such as the California Consumer Privacy
          Act (CCPA), you may also have the right to request disclosure of the
          categories of personal information collected and the purposes for
          which it is used. To exercise any of these rights, you may contact us
          directly at info@shipx.asia.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because ShipX operates across multiple regions, your information may
          be transferred, stored, or processed outside your country of
          residence, including in jurisdictions that may have different levels
          of data protection. In such cases, we take steps to ensure that your
          information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy,
          including implementing standard contractual clauses or other
          appropriate safeguards where required by law.
          <br />
          <br />
          ShipX is not directed to children under the age of sixteen, and we do
          not knowingly collect information from minors. If we discover that a
          child has submitted personal information to us, we will promptly take
          steps to delete such information from our systems. Parents or
          guardians who believe that their child has provided information to
          ShipX are encouraged to contact us immediately.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may use your information to communicate with you regarding
          important updates about ShipX, changes to our services, and other
          transactional notices. Marketing communications, when applicable, will
          only be sent with your consent or as permitted by law. You may
          unsubscribe or opt out of these messages at any time by following the
          instructions provided in the communication or by contacting us.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our website and platform may contain links to third-party websites or
          may integrate with external services. These third parties are
          independent of ShipX, and their privacy practices are not covered by
          this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
          third-party services you choose to engage with, as we do not accept
          responsibility for their actions or policies.
          <br />
          <br />
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ShipX, INFI COMMERCE
          ECOSYSTEMS PTE. LTD., Amilo, and SG Link disclaim liability for any
          indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from
          the unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure of data, particularly
          in cases beyond our reasonable control. You acknowledge and agree that
          your use of ShipX is at your own risk, subject to the protections and
          limitations described herein.
          <br />
          <br />
          This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time to reflect
          changes in technology, legal requirements, or our business practices.
          Any updates will be published on this page with a revised “Effective
          Date.” We encourage you to review the Policy periodically to stay
          informed about how we protect your information. Continued use of our
          services after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised
          terms.
          <br />
          <br />
          This Policy is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with
          the laws of Singapore. Any disputes arising from or related to this
          Policy or the use of ShipX shall be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore, unless otherwise required by
          applicable law. Where appropriate, the parties may agree to resolve
          disputes through binding arbitration in Singapore in accordance with
          recognized arbitration procedures.
