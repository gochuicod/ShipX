    "message": "This Privacy Policy describes how ShipX, a joint platform operated by Amilo and SG Link under the ownership of INFI COMMERCE ECOSYSTEMS PTE. LTD., collects, uses, shares, and protects the personal information of individuals and businesses that engage with our services. ShipX respects your privacy and is committed to safeguarding the information you provide to us. By accessing or using our platform, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy and agree to the practices it describes.\n\nWe collect personal information in several ways, both directly and indirectly. When you register for an account, request services, complete forms, or communicate with our support team, you may provide details such as your full name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping information, payment details, and company identifiers. We also gather technical information automatically when you access our website, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, location data where legally permitted, and records of the pages you visit or the features you use. To improve our services, we may employ cookies, analytics tools, and similar tracking technologies that store preferences, recognize repeat visits, and analyze usage trends. In certain situations, we may also obtain information from third-party partners such as logistics providers, payment processors, and verification services to facilitate your transactions and maintain security.\n\nThe information we collect is used for a wide range of purposes that are essential to the operation of ShipX. Primarily, we use it to provide the services you request, including account management, shipment processing, order fulfillment, billing, and customer support. We also process information to improve and optimize our platform, conduct internal analytics, protect the integrity of our systems, prevent fraudulent activity, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. When permitted by law and with your consent where required, we may use your contact details to send you updates, promotional offers, and marketing communications related to ShipX and its partners. At the same time, we respect your right to opt out of such communications at any time.\n\nShipX operates under different legal bases depending on the nature of the data processing. In some cases, your consent provides the foundation for our activities, particularly when it comes to marketing communications or optional services. In other situations, we rely on the necessity of processing in order to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, such as delivering shipments or processing payments. We may also process data where required by law, for example, to maintain tax records or respond to lawful requests from authorities. Finally, we may process data based on our legitimate interests in operating and securing our platform, provided those interests do not override your rights and freedoms.\n\nCookies and similar technologies play an important role in the functionality of our services. They enable us to remember your settings, authenticate your account, improve security, and deliver a more personalized experience. We also use cookies to measure traffic, analyze site performance, and support marketing campaigns. You have the ability to control or disable cookies through your browser settings; however, please note that certain features of ShipX may not work properly if cookies are disabled.\n\nWe do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where sharing data is necessary. We may disclose your information to our affiliates, including Amilo and SG Link, as part of our joint operations. Trusted service providers, such as data hosting companies, IT support providers, analytics vendors, payment processors, and logistics partners, may also have access to your data when assisting us in delivering services. We may disclose information if required to comply with laws, regulations, or legal processes, or in order to protect the safety, rights, or property of ShipX, our users, or the public. Furthermore, in the event of a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred to the successor entity.\n\nSecurity of your information is a top priority for us. ShipX employs a combination of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption, firewalls, secure data storage, and restricted access protocols. While we strive to maintain the highest level of security, no online transmission or electronic storage method can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, and you acknowledge that you provide information at your own risk.\n\nWe retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy. This includes the duration of your account, the period required to comply with legal obligations, and any time necessary to resolve disputes or enforce agreements. Once data is no longer required, we take reasonable steps to delete, anonymize, or otherwise securely dispose of it.\n\nYour rights regarding your personal information vary depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside. In certain regions, such as the European Union under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or in jurisdictions with similar laws, you may have the right to access the information we hold about you, request corrections, demand deletion of your data subject to lawful exceptions, restrict or object to processing, and request data portability. In jurisdictions with consumer privacy protections, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you may also have the right to request disclosure of the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which it is used. To exercise any of these rights, you may contact us directly at info@shipx.asia.\n\nBecause ShipX operates across multiple regions, your information may be transferred, stored, or processed outside your country of residence, including in jurisdictions that may have different levels of data protection. In such cases, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy, including implementing standard contractual clauses or other appropriate safeguards where required by law.\n\nShipX is not directed to children under the age of sixteen, and we do not knowingly collect information from minors. If we discover that a child has submitted personal information to us, we will promptly take steps to delete such information from our systems. Parents or guardians who believe that their child has provided information to ShipX are encouraged to contact us immediately.\n\nWe may use your information to communicate with you regarding important updates about ShipX, changes to our services, and other transactional notices. Marketing communications, when applicable, will only be sent with your consent or as permitted by law. You may unsubscribe or opt out of these messages at any time by following the instructions provided in the communication or by contacting us.\n\nOur website and platform may contain links to third-party websites or may integrate with external services. These third parties are independent of ShipX, and their privacy practices are not covered by this Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you choose to engage with, as we do not accept responsibility for their actions or policies.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, ShipX, INFI COMMERCE ECOSYSTEMS PTE. LTD., Amilo, and SG Link disclaim liability for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure of data, particularly in cases beyond our reasonable control. You acknowledge and agree that your use of ShipX is at your own risk, subject to the protections and limitations described herein.\n\nThis Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or our business practices. Any updates will be published on this page with a revised “Effective Date.” We encourage you to review the Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Continued use of our services after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.\n\nThis Policy is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. Any disputes arising from or related to this Policy or the use of ShipX shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Where appropriate, the parties may agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration in Singapore in accordance with recognized arbitration procedures.",
